            this is where you will learn how to use this website to its full potencial <br>
            to start i will anwser a question <br>
            what is use for this website <br>
            mostly to "borrow" code snipets from somewhere (github chat gpt ...) <br>
            and this site is to auto format it and change names so there is no name colision <br>
            <br>
            you first need to type in the code into the index text-box and select when the cookie will get removed <br>
            (we do not want to stalk you with cookeis, we use the cookies to store the code you edit trough the sites <br>
            and it is not given to any third parties) <br>
            <br>
            then you select what do you want to do with it <br>
            configuration - is a automated edyting system <br>
            namechange - is used for changing names inside the code (names for variables functions ...) <br>
            <br>
            configurattion has 4 main systems <br>
            { clean   - moves every { to be placed on the next line and not directly on the end of a line <br>
            = count   - makes every = sighn have spaces before and after it, it aso desent split == =! but it makes them have space before and after <br>
            3 spaces  - makes every couple of spaces on the start of a line be a multiple of a 3 <br>
            coments   - removes every // coment <br>
            <br>
            namechange is simpler <br>
            you enter in text and what you want to swap it with and then tick the box next to every line you want work <br>
            there is a button that makes it also include every existence of the string (also inside other words) <br>
